Using First Order Logic to fetch the appropriate drug for a patient

Language: Python 3.7
Libraries: None

Brief Description:

* Drafting knowledge-base by stocking facts and incidents
* Implementing First Order Logical Programming to infer results and display warnings accordingly

Project Description:

RipeApe  pharmacy  is  developing  a  self-service  automated  system  to  alert  customers  about potential drug interactions for both prescription and over-the-counter drugs. Many medications should not be taken together or should not be taken if a patient has certain symptoms and allergies. Evaluating all the criteria for whether a patient can take a particular medication requires the patient's medical history and expert knowledge from a health care provider. The system, however, can provide an instant guideline to keep patients informed and minimize the risks.
You are assigned by RipeApe to develop a beta version of the system using the first order logic inference. Patient history and drug compatibility data will be encoded as first order logic clauses in  the  knowledge  base.  The  program  takes  a  query  of  new  drug  list  and  provide  a  logical conclusion whether toissue a warning.You will use first-order logic resolutionto solve this problem.

First Order.py - The input is the knowledge base and we find out if a drug can be administered or not.
